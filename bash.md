# Bash Notes

This section focuses on foundational Bash commands for navigating the terminal and managing filesâ€”especially in the context of setting up GitHub projects. It includes practical examples for creating repositories, moving between directories, and inspecting your file system.

Topics include:
- Creating a Git repo from Bash
- Navigation (`cd`, `ls`, `pwd`)
- File operations (`touch`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `mv`, `cp`)
- Viewing hidden files and directory structure
- Terminal shortcuts and command chaining
